# LastPassVulnerabilities

Author: Max Chee

This repo describes 2 vulnerabilties which I have discovered on Last Pass iOS App. As the vulnerability requires a jailbroken device to subvert the local authentication used by LastPass, they have decided not to fix it.

Vulnerability #1: Bypass password authentication for LastPass lock screen Video Link : https://youtu.be/63PfHVSr8iw

Vulnerability #2: Bypass pin authentication for LastPass lock screen Video Link : https://youtu.be/C5j7drIylsQ

Detailed writeup for both vulnerability is available in the word document.
